NQSII
=====

The ``nsqii`` executor allows you to run your pipeline script by using the `NQSII <https://www.rz.uni-kiel.de/en/our-portfolio/hiperf/nec-linux-cluster>`_ resource manager.

Nextflow manages each process as a separate job that is submitted to the cluster by using the ``qsub`` command provided
by the scheduler.

Being so, the pipeline must be launched from a node where the ``qsub`` command is available, that is, in a common usage
scenario, the cluster `login` node.

To enable the NQSII executor simply set ``process.executor = 'nqsii'`` in the ``nextflow.config`` file.

Resource requests and other job characteristics can be controlled via the following process directives:

* :ref:`process-clusterOptions`
* :ref:`process-cpus`
* :ref:`process-memory`
* :ref:`process-queue`
* :ref:`process-time`
