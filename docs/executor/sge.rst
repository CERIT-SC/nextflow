SGE
===

The ``sge`` executor allows you to run your pipeline script by using a `Sun Grid Engine <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine>`_
cluster or a compatible platform (`Open Grid Engine <http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/>`_, `Univa Grid Engine <http://www.univa.com/products/grid-engine.php>`_, etc).

Nextflow manages each process as a separate grid job that is submitted to the cluster by using the ``qsub`` command.

Being so, the pipeline must be launched from a node where the ``qsub`` command is available, that is, in a common usage
scenario, the cluster `head` node.

To enable the SGE executor simply set ``process.executor = 'sge'`` in the ``nextflow.config`` file.

Resource requests and other job characteristics can be controlled via the following process directives:

* :ref:`process-clusterOptions`
* :ref:`process-cpus`
* :ref:`process-memory`
* :ref:`process-penv`
* :ref:`process-queue`
* :ref:`process-time`
